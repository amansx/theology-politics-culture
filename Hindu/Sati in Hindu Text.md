“Let these women who are not widows, who have good husbands, enter (anointed) with unguent and butter. Let women without tears, without sorrow, and decorated with jewels, first proceed to the house.”

“Let these unwidowed dames with noble husbands adorn themselves with fragrant balm and unguent. Decked with fair jewels, tearless, free from sorrow, first let the dames go up to where he (the deceased) lies.”

**10.18.8**

**उदी॑र्ष्व नार्य॒भि जी॑वलो॒कं ग॒तासु॑मे॒तमुप॑ शेष॒ एहि॑ । ह॒स्त॒ग्रा॒भस्य॑ दिधि॒षोस्तवे॒दं पत्यु॑र्जनि॒त्वम॒भि सं ब॑भूथ ॥**
**उदीर्ष्व नार्यभि जीवलोकं गतासुमेतमुप शेष एहि । हस्तग्राभस्य दिधिषोस्तवेदं पत्युर्जनित्वमभि सं बभूथ ॥**
ud īrṣva nāry abhi jīvalokaṃ gatāsum etam upa śeṣa ehi | hastagrābhasya didhiṣos tavedam patyur janitvam abhi sam babhūtha ||

**English translation:**

“Rise, woman, (and go) to the world of living beings; come, this man near whom you sleep is lifeless;you have enjoyed this state of being the wife of your husband, the suitor who took you by the band.”

“Rise! Come unto the world of life O woman! Come, he is lifeless by whose side you lie. As far as your married life to the one who seized your hand and wooed you as a lover is concerned - you have lived it out completely.”

**Comments**

“Genocide of Women in Hinduism”, by Sita Agarwal, - affirmed and endorsed in the Smritis and Puranas.

The Vedas alone are authority (*pramāṇam*) and if there is a conflict between them and the latter Smriti and Puranic literature, then the Vedic injunction alone is to be accepted and all else is rejected according to Manusmriti.

Interpretation of Rigveda 10.18.7 pointed out by Maxmuller. In this mantra, a widow is advised to go ahead (Agre) in her life rather than go in funeral pyre after her husband’s death. The word Agre was misinterpreted as Agni (fire).



## Atharva Veda

Atharvaveda 18.3.1 is mostly quoted as Vedic Mantra which supports Sati Pratha. [Translation by Griffith]
Choosing her husband's world, O man, this woman lays herself down beside thy lifeless body. Preserving faithfully the ancient custom. Bestow upon here both wealth and offspring. 



## Manu Smriti 

<u>5.155</u>

**कामं तु क्षपयेद् देहं पुष्पमूलफलैः शुभैः ।**
**न तु नामापि गृह्णीयात् पत्यौ प्रेते परस्य तु ॥ १५५ ॥**

*kāmaṃ tu kṣapayed dehaṃ puṣpamūlaphalaiḥ śubhaiḥ* |
*na tu nāmāpi gṛhṇīyāt patyau prete parasya tu* || 155 ||

Well might she macerate her body by means of pure flowers, roots and fruits; but she should not even mention the name of another man, after her husband is dead—(155).

**Medhātithi’s commentary (manubhāṣya):**

As in the case of men, so in that of women also suicide is forbidden. 

As for what Aṅgiras has said—‘**they should die after their husband**’,—this also is not an obligatory act, and so it is not that it must be done. Because in connection with it there is an eulogium bestowed upon the results proceeding from such suicide. 

Thus then, the performing of the act being possible only for one who is desirous of obtaining the said result, the act stands on the same footing as the Śyena sacrifice. That is, in connection with the Śyena sacrifice we have the Vedic text—‘one may kill living beings by means of the Śyena sacrifice,’—and this makes the performance of this sacrifice possible; but only for one who has become blinded by extreme hatred; so that when the man does perform the act, it does not become regarded as ‘Dharma,’ a ‘meritorious act’; exactly in the same manner, when the widow happens to have a very strong desire for the results accruing from the act of suicide, it is open to her to disobey the prohibition of it and kill herself; but in so doing she cannot be regarded as acting according to the scriptures. From this it is clear that the act of killing herself after her husband is clearly forbidden for the woman. Further, in view of the distinct Vedic text—‘one shall not die before the span of his life is run out’—being contradicted by the Smṛti-text of Aṅgiras, this latter is open to bring assumed to have some other meaning. Just as in the case of the Smṛti rule ‘one should take the final bath after having read the Veda’,—the injunction of the bath, as pertaining to one who has not yet studied the meaning of the Vedic texts, has been taken as having a different meaning.



[Parasara Smriti 4.32](https://archive.org/details/ParasharaSmriti/page/n35)

**If a woman follows her departed lord, by burning herself on the same funeral pyre**, she will dwell in heaven for as many years as there are hairs on the human frame, — which reach the number of three crores and a half.

[Vishnu Dharma Sutra 25.14](https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe07/sbe07027.htm)

After the death of her husband, to preserve her chastity, or to ascend the pile after him.

[Agni Purana 222.223](https://archive.org/details/AgniPuranaUnabridgedEnglishMotilal/page/n589)

The widow who practices self-control and austerities after the death of her husband, goes to heaven…the widow who burns herself on the same funeral pire wth her husband also goes to heaven.
