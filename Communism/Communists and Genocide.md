# Communists and Genocide

**Mass killings under communist regimes** occurred through a variety of means during the 20th century, including 
> Executions
> Famine
> Deaths through forced labour
> Deportation
> Imprisonment

**The Double Genocide Theory (Red Holocaust)** is the idea that two genocides of equal severity occurred in Eastern Europe, that of the Holocaust against Jews perpetrated by the Nazis and a second genocide that the Soviet Union committed against the local population

The theory first became popular in Lithuania in the early 1990s. 
A more aggressive version of the theory accuses Jews of **complicity in Soviet Repression** and characterize local participation in the Holocaust as retaliation, especially in:
> Lithuania
> Eastern Poland, and 
> Northern Romania

**The Holodomor (moryty holodom, 'to kill by starvation')** also known as the Terror-Famine or the Great Famine, was a man-made famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians.
The Holodomor was part of the wider Soviet famine of 1932–1933 which affected the major grain-producing areas of the Soviet Union. 

Some historians conclude that the famine was planned and exacerbated by Joseph Stalin in order to eliminate a Ukrainian independence movement. This conclusion is supported by Raphael Lemkin.

Others suggest that the famine arose because of rapid Soviet industrialisation and collectivization of agriculture.
Ukraine was one of the largest grain-producing states in the USSR and was subject to unreasonably higher grain quotas, when compared to the rest of the country. 
This caused Ukraine to be hit particularly hard by the famine. Early estimates of the death toll by scholars and government officials vary greatly. A joint statement to the United Nations signed by 25 countries in 2003 declared that **7–10 million died**. However, current scholarship estimates a range significantly lower, with **3.5 to 5 million** victims. The famine's widespread impact on Ukraine persists to this day.

Since 2006, the Holodomor has been recognized by the European Parliament, Ukraine alongside 22 countries, as a genocide against the Ukrainian people carried out by the Soviet regime.
